        <ol>
          <li>
            Clone the GitHub repository containing the web client code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:
            <code style={{marginLeft: "1%"}}>npm install</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Start the web client by running the following command in the terminal:
            <code style={{marginLeft: "1%"}}>npm start</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a web browser and enter the URL: <code style={{marginLeft: "1%"}}>http://localhost:3000</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure the web client settings by navigating to the settings page. The available settings and their explanations are listed below.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Web Client Settings</h2>
        <p>The web client provides various settings to customize its behavior. Here are the available settings and their explanations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rosbridge Server IP Address:</strong> Enter the IP address of the Rosbridge server. This is the server that connects the web application to the ROS environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Port:</strong> Specify the port number for the Rosbridge server.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Resolution Width:</strong> Set the width of the video resolution for the ROS camera feed.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Resolution Height:</strong> Set the height of the video resolution for the ROS camera feed.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Frame Width:</strong> Specify the width of the video frame for the ROS camera feed.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Frame Height:</strong> Specify the height of the video frame for the ROS camera feed.</li>
            <li><strong>Show Battery Status:</strong> Toggle to display the battery status in the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Input Teleoperation:</strong> Enable or disable manual teleoperation control input (default is using the joystick).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Running with a ROS Robot</h2>
        <p>If you want to run the web client with a ROS robot, make sure to follow these additional steps:</p>
        <p>(P.S. this is assuming you already have ROS installed on your system, if not you can follow this <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation">link</a> for instructions. Please note that for our testing purposes, we used the noetic version of ROS):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            SSH into your robot (for our intents and purposes, we utilized a TurtleBot3 Burger model)
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the GPS2IP app (paid version T-T) -> settings -> under "NMEA messages to send," only check "GLL" -> home page -> ensure "Enable GPS2IP" is turned on at home page -> turn off iOS auto-sleep setting to prevent the app from stopping the publishing of GPS information -> lastly place the phone onto the robot
          </li>
          <li>
            Launch the necessary ROS launch file to run vital nodes such as rosbridge, gps, and image compression (use sim.launch for simulation in Gazebo):
            <code style={{marginLeft: "1%"}}>roslaunch ros-robot real.launch</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run any other nodes that you want (wall following, line following, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the web client has the correct Rosbridge server IP and port set within settings (you can check via the "current configurations" button).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want the camera to show up, make sure that the correct camera topic is being published properly and that the VideoFeed component has the correct topic listed within the subscriber as sometimes it can be /raspicam or /camera, there should be config values for both already
          </li>
          <li>
            Enjoy using the web client to control and monitor your ROS robot!
          </li>
        </ol>
